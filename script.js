/*
How many hours did you spend on this assignment?:
Around 8 hours
What part of the assignment did you spend the most time on?:
Initially it was debugging, but once that was sorted then I spent a lot of time on the UIUX like the scripts/narratives and also edited the HTML along with the javascript.
How comfortable did you feel with this assignment? (1-5):
3
Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?:
I really like how it looks, and how I worked with both the javascript and HTML to work together.
What's one aspect of your code you would like specific, elaborate feedback on?: Whether the logic makes sense, and if there are certain areas/tips and tricks that I can use to make the code more elegant.

// Win scenario 1: User chooses Scissors, Program chooses Paper OR User chooses Paper, Program chooses Stone OR User chooses Stone, Program chooses Scissors
// Lose scenario 1: User chooses Scissors, Program chooses Stone OR User chooses Paper, Program chooses Scissors OR User chooses Stone, Program chooses Paper
// Tie scenario 1: User chooses Scissors, Program chooses Scissors OR user chooses Paper, Program chooses Paper OR User chooses Stone, Program chooses stone
